LaTeX templates
===============

This is a small collection of my most used LaTeX templates. I use them for
various things such as essays, lab reports, poems, HowTo's and whatever.
Feel free to use them for your own LaTeX documents.

The PDF-files in the "PDFs" directory are how the document will look like when
compiled.
