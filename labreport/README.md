Lab report template
===================

This is the LaTeX-template i use when writing lab reports quickly and easy.
The lab reports I write for school are often numbered, hence the Makefile for
easy numbering. That when I only need to edit content.tex and not the lab.tex.
Once I written my report I simply run "make LAB=3" for lab report 3. The heading
then changes to "Lab report 3" and also the resulting PDF file will be named
lab3.pdf.
